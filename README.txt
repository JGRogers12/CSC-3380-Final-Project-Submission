We have implemented a simple implementation of phishing software on a web platform.
To reach the site you can visit https://juliarogers20187.wixsite.com/ood-project.
Here you can create an account,  login, and send our "Course Evaluation" phishing template 
to the user of yourself. 

There are three html email templates included in the repository. 
Each template contains a unique tracking link that when clicked collects the Date/Time, 
IP address, location, User agent, Host Name, and ISP

To access these results you can vitit grabify.link and login to see the results of sending the 
Course evaluation template you send from the web platform using the code 4CGSO6

Although we only implemented the course evaluation template, you can also view where the results
would be located for the other two templates we designed: LSU Texas Bowl (628QHQ) and 
Password Reset email (UPEOUV)
